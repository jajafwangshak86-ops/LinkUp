# Recovery Phrase Implementation

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The Recovery Phrase feature has been implemented to provide users with information about their custodial wallet and security options.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Recovery Phrase Screen
**File:** `linkup/app/(tabs)/profile/recovery-phrase.tsx`

A comprehensive screen that explains LinkUp's custodial wallet model and provides:
- Wallet address display with copy functionality
- Security information about custodial wallets
- Benefits of custodial wallet management
- Security tips and best practices
- Option to contact support for wallet export

### 2. Navigation Fix
**File:** `linkup/app/(tabs)/profile/security.tsx`

Fixed the "Recovery Phrase" button to navigate to the new recovery phrase screen:
```typescript
onPress={() => router.push('/(tabs)/profile/recovery-phrase')}
```

### 3. Database Migration Script
**File:** `linkup_app/apps/backend/scripts/migrate-2fa-fields.ts`

Created a migration script to add 2FA fields to existing user accounts:
- `twoFactorEnabled` (default: false)
- `twoFactorSecret` (default: null)
- `recoveryCodes` (default: empty array)
- `tempLoginToken` (default: null)
- `tempLoginExpires` (default: null)
- `passwordResetToken` (default: null)
- `passwordResetExpires` (default: null)

## Key Features

### Custodial Wallet Explanation
The screen clearly explains that LinkUp uses a custodial wallet model where:
- Private keys are encrypted and stored securely on servers
- Users can recover accounts using email/password
- No need to manage seed phrases manually
- Easy account recovery process

### Security Information
Provides users with:
- Wallet address with copy functionality
- Information about encryption and security
- Benefits of custodial vs non-custodial wallets
- Security tips and recommendations
- Link to enable 2FA and biometric auth

### Future Export Option
Includes a section for users who want to export their wallet:
- Explains that export requires contacting support
- Additional verification needed for security
- Direct link to help/support

## Running the Migration

To add 2FA fields to existing accounts:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd linkup_app/apps/backend

# Run the migration script
npx ts-node scripts/migrate-2fa-fields.ts
```

Expected output:
```
🔄 Starting 2FA fields migration...
✅ Connected to MongoDB
📊 Found X users
✅ Updated X users
📝 Matched X users
✅ Verification: X/X users now have 2FA fields
✅ Migration completed successfully
```

## User Flow

1. User goes to Settings → Security & Privacy
2. Taps on "Recovery Phrase" under Wallet Security
3. Views wallet address and custodial wallet information
4. Can copy wallet address
5. Reads security tips and recommendations
6. Can contact support if they want to export wallet

## Security Considerations

### Custodial Model Benefits
- No risk of losing seed phrases
- Easy account recovery
- Better UX for non-crypto users
- Managed security by platform

### Security Measures
- Encrypted private key storage
- 2FA support
- Biometric authentication
- Email verification
- Password reset flow

### User Education
The screen educates users about:
- What custodial wallets are
- How their keys are secured
- Why this model is safer for most users
- Additional security options available

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `linkup/app/(tabs)/profile/recovery-phrase.tsx` - Recovery phrase screen
- `linkup_app/apps/backend/scripts/migrate-2fa-fields.ts` - Migration script
- `linkup_app/apps/backend/scripts/README.md` - Migration documentation
- `linkup/RECOVERY_PHRASE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

### Modified
- `linkup/app/(tabs)/profile/security.tsx` - Added navigation to recovery phrase

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. ✅ Navigate to Settings → Security & Privacy
2. ✅ Tap "Recovery Phrase" button
3. ✅ Verify screen loads correctly
4. ✅ Verify wallet address displays
5. ✅ Test copy wallet address functionality
6. ✅ Verify all information sections display
7. ✅ Test "Contact Support" button navigation

### Migration Testing
1. ✅ Run migration script on test database
2. ✅ Verify all users get new fields
3. ✅ Verify existing data not overwritten
4. ✅ Verify script is idempotent (can run multiple times)

## Notes

- This implementation focuses on educating users about custodial wallets
- Private keys remain encrypted on the backend
- Users who want full control can request wallet export through support
- The migration script is safe to run multiple times
- All TypeScript errors have been resolved

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add actual private key export functionality (with verification)
2. Add option to convert to non-custodial wallet
3. Add wallet backup to encrypted cloud storage
4. Add multi-signature wallet support
5. Add hardware wallet integration option
